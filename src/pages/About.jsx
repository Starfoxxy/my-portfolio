        Hi, I’m <span className="text-blue-500 font-semibold">Athena Jacob</span>!<br /><br />

        I started my career as a Product Manager in digital marketing, where I learned how to craft strategies, connect with audiences, and drive impactful campaigns. Along the way, I discovered my true passion lies in building technology that empowers people, which led me to transition into <span className="text-blue-500 font-semibold">software engineering</span>.<br /><br />

        From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by robotics and interactive technologies; from controlling battle bots to immersive headset-based games. That curiosity sparked my love for creating solutions that combine creativity, logic, and hands-on innovation.<br /><br />

        My ultimate goal is to become an <span className="text-purple-500 font-semibold">entrepreneur and a leader</span>, building meaningful products and using technology as a force for good. I’m deeply committed to helping those in need, giving a voice to the marginalized, and creating opportunities for people who have faced hardship or violence. In every project I tackle, I aim to merge technical excellence with empathy, designing software that makes a real difference in people’s lives.
